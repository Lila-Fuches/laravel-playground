## About Laravel Playground

Laravel Playground is a default installation of Laravel that we use at Lila Fuches for API development. This is a central installation that is adapted as our needs do, we would not recommend using this for your own systems unless directed by ourselves.


## Features

- Extendable Architecture taking several concepts from Domain Driven Design.
- API Versioning using URLs and namespacing.
- JSON Web Tokens extending the base Laravel Guards for a natural approach.
- Custom API middleware to return a JSON:API compliant Content-Type header.
- Custom API middleware to return profiling data while in development mode.
- Powerful User Agent Parsing Engine.
- Event Sourcing to store important events.
